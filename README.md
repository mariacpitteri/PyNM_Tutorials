# PyNM Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials for the [PyNM package](https://github.com/ppsp-team/PyNM) â€” a lightweight Python implementation of **Normative Modeling** designed to be approachable and easy to adopt.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Included

These tutorials walk through five different models provided by PyNM, all accessible through a unified interface and covering a broad range of common use cases:

- **Centiles**
- **LOESS**
- **Gaussian Process (GP)**
- **Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP)**
- **Generalized Additive Models of Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal of this repository is to help users **understand the basics of normative modeling** before progressing to more advanced tools like the [PCN Toolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit).
